Project Description: 
My project will be a music lyric generator, where the user can enter an artist name and song and get the lyrics to the song they entered in. I will havea a home page with images, information, and a button to take the user to the form for entering a song. The API I am using is here: https://lyricsovh.docs.apiary.io/#reference/0/lyrics-of-a-song/search

Wireframes: 
The first image is a photo of the homepage. It will include a fixed header, a section with a button to route you to the search form, related images in a grid, information about the page, and a footer. The second photo is the page that the use is routed when they click on the "Get some lyrics" button. It is a search form where the user can enter an artist and name of a song to get back the lyrics.

MVP/PostMVP:
My project reaches the MVP with 6 compnents planned that include the following: 

Header.jsx - set up for the header of the pages

LyricForm.jsx - the form where an artist and song can be inputed and the lyrics will render

Lyrics.jsx - the section with the lyrics button that takes you to the form page

Nav.jsx - the fixed navigational bar that takes you to different parts of the page and to the home page

PicSection.jsx - the grid of photos on the homepage

Footer.jsx - the footer with contact information

It will also include a file in the services folder called api-helper.js where I will retrieve information from the api.

My project also meets the other requirements such as the API, Router, grid etc. Should I finish reaching the MVP, my PostMVP would include an option to add songs to a list and remove them from the list, allowing the user to create their own playlist.
